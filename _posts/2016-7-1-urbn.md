<a name="introduction"></a>**Introduction**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
To get started with Urbn, create an empty GameObject in your scene, add the `UrbnBuilding` component to it, and then click the `Reset to default building` button in the component's inspector window. You should now have a small, unit building that you can customize further.

In Urbn, buildings are made up of a few key components. Instead of treating the entire building as an atomic structure, Urbn breaks them down into multiple components and thus enables extensive stylization without sacrificing ease of use.

Let's have a look at each of these components in turn.

<a name="buildings"></a>**Buildings**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
A building is the topmost component of the hierarchy. Think of a building as a 2D polygon consisting of a set of vertices, as seen from the top. You can interactively move the vertices and faces to shape the building.

When you select an UrbnBuilding GameObject in Unity, the vertices of its polygon are numbered and enumerated in the scene view. In the UrbnBuilding's inspector view, you can perform the following operations:

1) To delete a single vertex, select its index in the `Vertex Index` dropdown, and hit the `Delete Vertex` button.

2) To delete multiple vertices, check the `Multi-Delete` checkbox, select a range in the two dropdowns that appear, and hit the same delete button to delete the vertices in that range.

3) The `Generate` button refreshes and regenerates all the faces and the roof geometry.

4) The `Clear` button clears all the styling data and existing geometry of all the faces and the roof of the building. Note that this will delete all your building styling data.

5) The `Reset to default building` button will clear any existing geometry, and reset the building to square building of unit dimensions and unit height. This is a good way to create basic geometry to get started with creating a new building.

<a name="faces"></a>**Faces**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
When you generate geometry for a building, faces will automatically be created and updated for you. You can control the look of each face individually.

The UrbnFace component's inspector view contains the following controls:

1) The `Type` dropdown allows you to select one of two face types: Planar and Grid.
  
a) A planar face is a blank building face consisting of a single quad. This mode is great for reducing triangle count where you don't need detailed faces.

b) A grid face has a grid of meshes on it. This generates more geometry than a planar face, but is very flexible in terms of appearance.

2) `Grid Meshes` is a list of meshes you want to place on the face. Usually, you will want to place window meshes here. You can add multiple meshes to this list, and Urbn will randomly pick a mesh from this list, to vary the appearance of a building face. If left empty, no mesh will be placed, and an empty rectangle will be left in the generated geometry. You can add either direct meshes or prefabs to this list.

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6">
![]({{ site.url }}/img/urbn_face_inspector.png)
</div>
</div>

3) `Auto Mesh Size`, if enabled, will automatically get the window mesh size from the dimensions of the first mesh in the `Grid Meshes` list. This works really well if you have [set up the window meshes correctly](#window_mesh_setup). If you want to specify a custom mesh size, disable this box and you will be able to enter in your custom dimensions for height and width.

4) `Random Mesh Seed` is an integer that is used to randomly pick the window meshes from the `Grid Meshes` list. This is done to ensure that the window meshes will remain the same even when you regenerate or adjust the face. If you want to tweak the randomness, just change this number.

5) `Grid Padding` controls the horizontal and vertical spacing between the window meshes. 

6) Urbn will place as many window meshes as it can, on a given face, while obeying the `Grid Padding` constraints. By default, it vertically and horizontally centers the placed meshes on the face. You can move the `Horizontal Alignment` and `Vertical Alignment` sliders to tweak this alignment.

7) The `Grid Inset` controls how much window meshes are inset into a face. This options gives you the freedom to use a single window mesh, and still get a lot of variation in styles.

8) Urbn by default generates exterior walls only. If looked at from the inside of the building, these walls are invisible. However, Urbn has full support for thick walls. If a `Thickness` greater than zero is specified, an interior face will also be generated as a separate GameObject, attached as a child to the face. This separation between interior and exterior faces allows you to specify different materials to the inside and the outside of the face. For most use cases, you will want to set the `Grid Inset` equal to the value of the `Thickness`. However, this is retained as a separate parameter to enable advanced use cases where you may want the values to differ.

9) The `Add Vertices` buttons allow you to add new faces to the building. These buttons are intuitive, and are the only correct way to interactively add faces to the building.

10) In the `Materials` section, you can set the materials for the exterior and interior. This is the recommended way to set your material, instead of changing it in the MeshRenderer, so that it plays nicely with Urbn's preset system.

11) The `Texture Scale` field allows you to scale the UV mapping of materials onto the exterior and interior.

12) `Generate` and `Clear` work just like their counterparts on the `UrbnBuilding` component, except that in this case, `Clear` will not cause loss of style information. This is just a way to quickly disable, enable and refresh geometry.

13) You can add collision to a face by simply adding a MeshCollider component to it, and then clicking on the `UrbnFace` component's `Generate` button. Note that in order for this to work correctly, the face has to have a non-zero `Thickness`.

When you create a building, a roof will be automatically generated. You can simply select the roof and drag it vertically to change the height of the building. You can optionally have a non-zero `Thickness` of the roof if you plan to view the building's interior.

<a name="styling"></a>**Styling**

Faces in Urbn have a lot of parameters, and it is time consuming to individually set these for each face one at a time. Instead, Urbn has a styling system for quickly creating and applying preset styles.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
To create a style:

1) Change the `UrbnFace` parameters on any one building face, the way you want the style to appear.

2) Create a prefab in the project view.

3) Drag the face from the hierarchy view to the prefab in the project view.
</div>

<div class="col-sm-6">
To apply a style:

1) Select either a building or a face.

2) In the `Style Presets` in the inspector, select the prefab in the `Preset Face` field.

3) Click `Apply Style`.
</div>

<a name="api"></a>**API**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
Urbn has a C# API that enables building creation using code, in-game and in-editor.

Example:

**ProcEditor.cs**

{% highlight csharp %}
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEditor;
using System.Collections;

[CustomEditor(typeof(ProcExample))]
public class ProcEditor : Editor
{
    public override void OnInspectorGUI()
    {
        if (GUILayout.Button("Generate Procedurally"))
        {
            ((ProcExample)target).
                GenerateProcedurally();
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<div class="col-sm-6">
![]({{ site.url }}/img/urbn5.png)
</div>
</div>


**ProcExample.cs**

{% highlight csharp %}
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections.Generic;

[ExecuteInEditMode]
public class ProcExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void GenerateProcedurally()
    {
        // Delete existing buildings
        GameObject[] allObjects = FindObjectsOfType<GameObject>();
        for (int i = 0; i < allObjects.Length; i++)
        {
            if (allObjects[i].GetComponent<UrbnBuilding>() != null)
            {
                DestroyImmediate(allObjects[i]);
            }
        }

        // Create new buildings
        float size = 50;
        int x = 10, y = 10;
        float gap = 0.3f;

        float sizeX = size / x;
        float sizeY = size / y;

        for (int i = 0; i < x; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < y; j++)
            {
                // Create new GameObject
                var obj = new GameObject("bld" + i.ToString() + "_" + j.ToString());
                // Add an UrbnBuilding component to it
                var bld = obj.AddComponent<UrbnBuilding>();
                // Add vertices to the building
                bld.Verts = new List<Vector3>()
                {
                    new Vector3( i     * sizeX + gap , 0 ,  j    * sizeY + gap ),
                    new Vector3( (i+1) * sizeX - gap , 0 ,  j    * sizeY + gap ),
                    new Vector3( (i+1) * sizeX - gap , 0 , (j+1) * sizeY - gap ),
                    new Vector3( i     * sizeX + gap , 0 , (j+1) * sizeY - gap )
                };
                // Call this function after adding vertices, and before you try
                // to access any face in bld.Faces.
                bld.UpdateFaces();
                // Set a height
                bld.Height = 2.0f + Random.Range(0f, 5.0f);
                // Generate the building geometry
                bld.Generate();
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="caveats"></a>**Caveats & Notes**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">
Urbn does have a few caveats that you should keep in mind:

1) While undoing is supported on most operations, you may have to either manually generate geometry or deselect and then reselect a building to rebuild geometry after undoing.

2) Window meshes should be oriented as shown in the diagram. Note the coordinate axes and the origin point.

3) Creating geometry is fast, but when doing so, Urbn still creates and destroys mesh data rapidly. If you plan to create geometry in-game, Building.Generate() shouldn't be called frequently during normal gameplay. If you're editing all your buildings at design-time, there is no runtime cost of Urbn. You can even remove the UrbnBuilding and UrbnFace scripts if you want.

4) If you want to remove a building's roof or a wall, turn off the roof's or the wall's MeshRenderer instead of deleting the GameObject.

</div>

<div class="col-sm-6">
![]({{ site.url }}/img/urbn6.png)
</div>
</div>

5) You can copy-paste a building and move it upwards to place it vertically on top of the original building to add style variation within an apparent single building wall.

6) If you are using the C# API, and want to set any face parameters, be sure to call the `Building.UpdateFaces()` method immediately after you finish adding verts and before you try to access any faces. When you add/remove vertices on a building using the API, this method needs to be called to ensure that the building's face count is equal to its vertex count.

7) You can achieve a rich variety of styles by getting creative with the face parameters.
